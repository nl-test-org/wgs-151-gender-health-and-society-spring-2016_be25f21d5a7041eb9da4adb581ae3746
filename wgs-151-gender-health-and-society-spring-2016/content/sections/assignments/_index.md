Weekly Reading Reflections
--------------------------

For weeks 2–4 and 6–10, students will submit _brief_, written reading reflections in response to that week's readings. Students can reflect on a single reading or incorporate multiple readings. These reading reflections are due at the beginning of class and allow students to think about the material and serve as a basis for in-class discussion. Reading reflections are limited to one page and should address one of the following:

*   One new idea or fact that I learned is…
*   One implication for understanding gender and health is highlighted by…
*   Write a question of your own based on the readings that you think addresses an important issue and then answer your own question

Discussion Leaders
------------------

For weeks 2-4 and 6-10, students will rotate being assigned one of two types of Discussion Leaders. Students assigned to be Summary Discussants will prepare a very brief (1 minute) summary of the reading they are assigned to help orient the class. Students assigned to be Discussion Facilitators will prepare 3-4 comments about their assigned reading with accompanying questions that can be used to spark discussion; these students will then help to facilitate that portion of the discussion. Neither the summary or discussion questions need to be submitted.

Testimony / Opinion
-------------------

In preparation for an in-class mock state assembly meeting on human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations, students will be assigned a role to play and subsequently prepare **either** a 1.5-page written testimony to deliver (if a witness) **or** a 1.5-page written opinion (if an assembly member).

Final Project
-------------

Students will apply the research methods learned in class and integrate these with newly acquired substantive knowledge to create a research proposal (see appended description). Any scientific question that is of interest and related to gender and health may be chosen. Each student will then create a 2-page write-up and share their research proposal in class as an oral presentation.
