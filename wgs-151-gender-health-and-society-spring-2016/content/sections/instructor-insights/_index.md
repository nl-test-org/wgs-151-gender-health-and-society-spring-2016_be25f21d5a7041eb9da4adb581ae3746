Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _WGS.151 Gender, Health, and Society_ as it was taught by Dr. Brittany Charlton in Spring 2016.

This interdisciplinary course introduces students to gender as a theoretical concept and examines its relation to health, including public health practice, epidemiologic research, health policy, and clinical application. The focus includes global, domestic, and historical perspectives, using the following examples: cardiovascular disease, hormone therapy, pregnancy, birth, sexually transmitted infections, abortion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, contraceptives, and mental health.

The course draws on different disciplines, conceptual frameworks, and methodologic approaches in order to explore gender in relation to health while also considering other social determinants of health, including social class and race.

Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "Students bring a broad range of experiences to the course. For some students, this is the first time they are engaging with how sex-linked biology differs from gender. Other students have yet to think about health in an academic context. With good facilitation, these diverse groups of students can teach one another." "—Brittany Charlton" >}}
