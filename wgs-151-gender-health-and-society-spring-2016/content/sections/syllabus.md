Course Description
------------------

This interdisciplinary course will introduce students to gender as a theoretical concept and examine its relation to health, including public health practice, epidemiologic research, health policy, and clinical application. The focus will include global, domestic, and historical perspectives, using the following examples: cardiovascular disease, hormone therapy, pregnancy, birth, sexually transmitted infections, abortion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, contraceptives, and mental health. We will draw on different disciplines, conceptual frameworks, and methodologic approaches in order to understand gender in relation to health while also considering other social determinants of health, including social class and race.

Course Objectives
-----------------

*   Describe differences between gender, sex-linked biology, and sexuality as well as critically evaluate their use in health research, social and behavioral sciences, and health policy.
*   Evaluate the breadth of research and research methods in the study of gender and health.
*   Apply theoretical and methodological constructs learned in class to a range of health issues, taking into consideration additional social determinants including social class and race.
